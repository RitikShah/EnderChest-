      Welcome to your new EnderChest+. Through a focus in utilizing the space taken by negative matter, we can store an infinite amount of items, given some expensive materials for "safety".

      Explore this manual to learn more!


  - title: Navigation

      To navigate, click on the items on the right side items in your enderchest. Click these items will navigate upwards or downwards.

      Shift-clicking these items will skip to the first or last page.


  - title: Upgrading

      To upgrade your system, just place the required materials upon the mini-enderchest item on the right-hand side.
